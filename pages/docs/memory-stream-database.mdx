# Memory Stream Database
Smallville can also be used for just it's memory stream database, without needing to create agents. The memory stream is different from vector databases 
because memories are retrieved by recency and importance in addition to relevancy.

## Create a new connection
[Install the smallville server](/docs/quick-start-guide#download-and-run-the-server) and [setup the clients](/docs/programming-clients).

## Use the memory stream through the clients
Use the cilents to store and retrieve memories.
