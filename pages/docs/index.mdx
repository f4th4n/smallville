# Introduction to Smallville
Smallville is a framework to create generative agents for video games and simulations. 

## About Generative Agents
Generative Agents are characters capable of planning, storing memories, and reacting to observations.

If an agent observes their garden is on fire, the agent could retrieve their memories based on past experiences, create plans 
to put out the fire, and then realistically react to those plans to extinguish the flames. 
Agents are also able to hold believable conversations and coordinate plans with each other.

## Architecture Overview

Agents first retrieve relevant memories from their memory stream, update existing plans or create new ones, then act on those observations (ex. initiating or responding
to a conversation). Memory retrieval is scored by relevancy, importance, and recency.
