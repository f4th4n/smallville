# Running the example phaser simulation
Learn how to get started with a pre-made simulation and [view the code](https://github.com/nickm980/smallville/tree/main/examples)

## Simulation Information
The map consists of 8 main areas, traversable by the WASD keys
- School
- Basketball Court
- Park
- Appartments
- Supermarket
- Construction Site
- Ice Cream Shop
- Parking Lot

By default, there are 2 agents and a main character. The states of objects are able to be changed through the dashboard.

By default, the server will start on port 8080. To change this use the --port option.

[Download v1.2.0](https://github.com/nickm980/smallville/releases/download/v1.2.0/smallville-v1.2.0.zip)

```

## Clone the GitHub repository
