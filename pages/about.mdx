# About Smallville

Smallville was initially created by [nickm980](https://github.com/nickm980) in March of 2023. 
Smallville is a framework to create generative agents capable of planning, storing memories, and reacting to observations. 

If an agent observes their garden is on fire, the agent could retrieve their memories based on past experiences, create plans to put out the fire, 
and then realistically react to those plans. Agents are also able to hold believable conversations and coordinate plans with each other.
